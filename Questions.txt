Problem - 
	You are developing an application to track the attendance of the staff and students of an institution. Every "person" has his/her attendance marked as
	09/01/2020 - true
	10/01/2020 - false
	For your reference a Person class has been defined along with an IPersonService interface. A scenario for your BDD has also been added.
	Your task, should you choose to accept it (you have no choice actually :D), is to solve the following question and implement it in the application. 
	
Questions - 
1. Create your model/ entity classes for students and teachers. 
   Every teacher has an additional property called "StaffId". Every student should have a "Marks" property that stores marks for each subject.

2. Implement the IPersonService and define the methods declared in the interface.

3. Implement the scenario using your service and get the test to pass.

4. Now add a 5 sample students and get the output for the following
	a. Display the attendance of a single student.
	b. Display all the marks that he has scored.
